# UCSF Hack Mental Health 2019
# LevelUp

LevelUp connects millennial professionals who are unsure of their options for mental health services with the best therapists, articles, and resources.

We were inspired to build this project because some of our team members took several months to find a therapist. The current process for finding the right therapist through popular sites is slow, lacks transparency as to cost, and is typically couched in clinical language that is not accessible to a first-time therapy seeker.

While other sources are problem-focused, our product allows users to set goals for improvement and find the best therapist or resource to help them achieve their goal. In under two minutes users answer a few questions about their issue and set a goal for improvement. They are then presented with a list of mental health professionals and online services that are tailored to these areas to guide them towards their personal goal.
