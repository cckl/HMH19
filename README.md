# UCSF Hack Mental Health 2019
# LevelUp

LevelUp connects millennials who don't know what their options are for mental health services with the best therapists, articles, and apps to help them with their problem.

We came up with this idea because some of our team members took several months to find a therapist.

While other sources are problem-focused, our product allows users to set goals for improvement and find the best therapist or resource that can help them reach their goal. In under two minutes users answer a few questions about their issue, set a goal for improvement, and are presented with a list mental health professionals and online services that will help them reach that goal.
